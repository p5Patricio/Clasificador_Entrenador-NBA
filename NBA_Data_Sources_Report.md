# NBA Data Sources Investigation Report

## Executive Summary

This report investigates all major free NBA data sources, with emphasis on the `nba_api` Python package currently used by the project. It covers available endpoints, data granularity, historical depth, rate limits, alternative sources, and data requirements for common analytics use cases.

---

## 1. Current Project Ingestion Approach

**File:** `backend/nba_player_data.py`

The current pipeline:
1. Fetches all active players via `nba_api.stats.static.players.get_active_players()`
2. Iterates player-by-player calling `playercareerstats.PlayerCareerStats(player_id=...)`
3. Extracts either Regular Season (`get_data_frames()[0]`) or Playoffs (`get_data_frames()[1]`)
4. Filters by `SEASON_ID` and a minimum minutes threshold (`MIN >= 100`)
5. Appends to a combined DataFrame and exports to Excel

**Current columns ingested:**
`GP`, `GS`, `MIN`, `FGM`, `FGA`, `FG_PCT`, `FG3M`, `FG3A`, `FG3_PCT`, `FTM`, `FTA`, `FT_PCT`, `OREB`, `DREB`, `REB`, `AST`, `STL`, `BLK`, `TOV`, `PF`, `PTS`

**Observed limitations:**
- Only uses **season totals** (no per-game, per-36, per-100-poss, or advanced stats)
- Only covers **active players** (no retired/historical players)
- Looping over ~450 active players with `time.sleep(0.5)` per call is slow (~4+ minutes per run)
- No injury, lineup, tracking, or play-by-play data

## 4. Other Free Data Sources

### 4.1 Basketball-Reference (basketball-reference.com)
- **Scope:** Deep historical database; the gold standard for NBA researchers.
- **Data:** Season totals, per-game, per-36, per-100-poss, advanced stats (PER, BPM, VORP, WS, TS%, ORtg, DRtg), game logs, play-by-play (modern seasons), team stats, franchise histories, draft data, salaries.
- **Historical Depth:** 1946-47 (BAA inception) to present.
- **Access:** Web scraping (requires `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`/`pandas.read_html`). No official API.
- **Rate Limits / Reliability:** ~3-5 sec delay recommended. Aggressive scraping can trigger blocks. Very reliable, but scraping is fragile to HTML changes.
- **Coverage Gaps:**
  - Minutes: >99% complete back to 1976-77
  - STL/BLK/TOV: complete back to 1983-84
  - 3P/3PA: complete back to 1979-80
  - ORB/DRB: complete back to 1983-84
  - +/-: complete back to 1996-97
  - Play-by-play: roughly 2000s onward (varies by game)

### 4.2 data.nba.com / cdn.nba.com (Official NBA JSON Feeds)
- **Scope:** Official static JSON feeds used by NBA.com front end.
- **Data:** Schedule, standings, player bios, team rosters, live box scores, shot charts.
- **Access:** Direct HTTPS GET (no key). Example: `https://cdn.nba.com/static/json/liveData/boxscore/boxscore_{game_id}.json`
- **Rate Limits / Reliability:** Undocumented but generally permissive. Still requires `User-Agent` and `Referer` headers.

### 4.3 balldontlie.io API
- **Scope:** Simplified REST API for NBA data.
- **Data:** Players, teams, games, box scores, season averages, advanced stats, injuries, standings, betting odds, player props.
- **Access:** API key required (free tier available).
- **Rate Limits:**
  - Free: 5 req/min
  - All-Star ($9.99/mo): 60 req/min
  - GOAT ($39.99/mo): 600 req/min
- **Historical Depth:** Modern era (roughly 1979 onward for many endpoints, but varies).
- **Reliability:** Good for prototyping; not as deep or granular as `nba_api`. Many advanced endpoints are paywalled.

### 4.4 ESPN Hidden API
- **Scope:** Unofficial API powering ESPN.com.
- **Data:** Box scores, team/player stats, schedules, summaries, play-by-play.
- **Access:** `https://site.web.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/...`
- **Rate Limits / Reliability:** Undocumented. Can change without notice. Good backup source.

### 4.5 pbpstats.com / API
- **Scope:** Play-by-play derived stats.
- **Data:** On/off data, WOWY, lineup stats, possession-level metrics.
- **Access:** Public API for some endpoints; deeper access requires subscription.
- **Reliability:** Highly specialized; excellent for lineup/possession analytics.

### 4.6 Community / Aggregated Datasets
- **Kaggle:** Pre-built datasets (season stats, shot logs, play-by-play). Quality varies; check provenance.
- **FiveThirtyEight GitHub:** Historical RAPTOR data (2014 onward) freely downloadable.
- **Dunks & Threes / BBall Index / Crafted NBA:** Public leaderboards for EPM, LEBRON, DARKO, DRIP (not raw data APIs, but valuable reference).

## 5. Historical Depth Comparison

| Source | Earliest Season | Play-by-Play | Tracking Data | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| `stats.nba.com` (`nba_api`) | ~1946 (varies by endpoint) | V2/V3 from ~1996 | 2013-14 onward (SportVU/Second Spectrum) | Most endpoints work reliably from 1996-97 onward. Some newer endpoints (tracking, hustle) only from 2013-14. |
| Basketball-Reference | 1946-47 | ~2000s onward | N/A (aggregated only) | Best for cross-era historical research. |
| balldontlie | ~1979-80 | Limited | None | Simpler schema; good for modern era. |
| data.nba.com / cdn | ~1996 | Modern | Modern | Front-end feeds; not guaranteed for old seasons. |

### Key Historical Milestones
- **1946-47:** BAA founding; Basketball-Reference has basic totals.
- **1973-74:** STL/BLK/TOV first officially tracked in NBA.
- **1979-80:** Three-point line introduced.
- **1983-84:** STL/BLK/TOV consistently complete in most sources.
- **1996-97:** Play-by-play widely available; +/- tracked.
- **2013-14:** Player tracking (SportVU) introduced; hustle/tracking endpoints begin.
- **2014-15:** Second Spectrum tracking begins.

## 6. Rate Limits & Reliability

### `nba_api` / `stats.nba.com`
- **No documented rate limit**, but the backend uses Cloudflare and can ban IPs temporarily.
- **Best Practice:** Add **0.6–1.0 second delay** between requests (project currently uses 0.5s, which is borderline).
- **Headers:** Must include realistic `User-Agent`, `Referer: https://www.nba.com/`, and `Accept` headers (nba_api handles this automatically).
- **Reliability:** Generally good during off-peak. Shot chart and tracking endpoints are the most restricted and may return empty datasets or 403s, especially for recent games or high-profile players.
- **Retry Logic:** Implement exponential backoff on `429` or `ConnectionError`.

### Basketball-Reference
- **Best Practice:** 3–5 seconds between page requests.
- **Reliability:** Very high uptime. HTML structure changes rarely but can break scrapers.

### balldontlie
- **Hard limits:** 5 req/min (free), 60 req/min (All-Star), 600 req/min (GOAT).
- **Reliability:** Good. Well-documented but paywalled for advanced features.

### General Tips
- Cache responses locally to avoid re-fetching static data (player lists, schedules).
- Use bulk endpoints (`leaguedashplayerstats`) instead of looping over individual players (`playercareerstats`) when possible — this reduces hundreds of calls to **one call**.

## 7. Data Requirements by Use Case

### 7.1 Player Profiles (Current Status)
**Currently implemented:** Basic bio + season totals + shot charts + cluster comparison.

**Data needed:**
- Bio: `commonplayerinfo` (height, weight, age, draft, experience)
- Season stats: `playercareerstats` or `leaguedashplayerstats` (totals, per-game, advanced)
- Shot chart: `shotchartdetail` (x/y coordinates, zones)
- Headshots: `https://cdn.nba.com/headshots/nba/latest/260x190/{player_id}.png`
- **Enhancement opportunities:** Add per-36/per-100-poss stats, tracking splits (drives, catch-and-shoot), defensive metrics (opponent FG%), and clutch splits for richer profiles.

### 7.2 Team Stats
**Data needed:**
- `leaguedashteamstats` — Team totals/per-game/advanced
- `leaguestandings` / `leaguestandingsv3` — W/L, conference rank, streaks
- `teamdashboardbygeneralsplits` — Home/away, rest days, opponent strength
- `teamdashptshots` / `teamdashptpass` / `teamdashptreb` — Team tracking
- `boxscorefourfactorsv3` — Dean Oliver Four Factors (shooting, turnovers, rebounding, free throws)

### 7.3 Game Predictions
**Data needed:**
- **Historical box scores:** `leaguegamelog`, `boxscoretraditionalv3`, `boxscoreadvancedv3`
- **Rolling averages:** Aggregate last 10/20/30 games per team (Four Factors, ORtg, DRtg, pace)

## 8. Strategic Recommendations for This Project

1. **Switch to bulk ingestion**
   - Replace the per-player `playercareerstats` loop with `leaguedashplayerstats`.
   - One API call returns **all players** for a season with totals, per-game, per-36, per-100-poss, and advanced stats.
   - Reduces ingestion time from ~4 minutes to **< 1 second**.

2. **Expand stat columns**
   - Current clustering uses only basic counting stats.
   - Add efficiency stats (`TS_PCT`, `EFG_PCT`), advanced stats (`USG_PCT`, `AST_PCT`, `REB_PCT`, `PIE`), and tracking stats (`DRIVE_PTS`, `CATCH_SHOOT_PTS`, `PULL_UP_PTS`) for much richer player profiles.

3. **Add game-log support**
   - Use `playergamelog` / `teamgamelog` to support rolling averages and trend analysis.

4. **Add shot-chart depth**
   - Already using `shotchartdetail`. Consider adding zone-based efficiency comparisons (e.g., corner 3%, mid-range, rim) to the player profile.

5. **Cache static data**
   - Player/team ID mappings change rarely. Cache them to avoid redundant API calls.

6. **Improve rate-limit handling**
   - Increase sleep to **0.6–1.0s** when individual endpoints are required.
   - Add exponential backoff retry logic.

7. **Consider Basketball-Reference as fallback**
   - For historical data pre-1996 or for advanced metrics not in `nba_api` (e.g., BPM, VORP), scrape Basketball-Reference or use their downloadable CSVs where available.
